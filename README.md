# **Windows 11 Pro 25H2 – ULTIMATE PRO MODE + HARD MODE + TPM PRIVACY + CLASSIC UI**
**Clean. Fast. Local. No Ads. No Copilot. No Bing. No Cloud Telemetry. No Dark Patterns.**

This configuration turns Windows 11 Pro into what it **should** have shipped as:

* A **local-first**, **private**, **stable**, **professional workstation**
* Without Microsoft trying to steer you into **Microsoft accounts**, **Copilot**, **adware**, **OneDrive lock-in**, **cloud logs**, or **app auto-provisioning**

This script is designed for:

* Performance users
* Creatives
* Developers
* IT professionals
* People who **want control back** over their system

And for anyone who thinks:

> *“Windows 11 feels like a billboard and a data funnel.”*

This turns it back into:

> **Windows 7 Pro energy**, but modern + secure.

## 🧠 **TPM Privacy Sandbox — What That Means**

This script **does NOT disable TPM.**
TPM is still used for:

* Secure boot
* Disk encryption keys
* Keychain protection

But we **block the cloud-facing parts**, preventing TPM from being used for:

* Device Attestation to Microsoft identity systems
* Auto-binding Windows to Microsoft Accounts
* Silent cloud-based compliance scoring
* Remote trust telemetry reporting

**Your machine remains secure — just not enrolled in Microsoft’s “trust pipeline”.**

---

## 🎨 **Classic UI Mode Included**

This restores the **professional desktop workflow**:

* Classic right-click menu
* Explorer shows all folders sidebar
* Proper status bar
* Drag & drop to taskbar restored
* Taskbar aligned left like Windows 7/10
* **Open-Shell** installed for clean Start menu without ads or app suggestions

Your desktop becomes:

> Quiet, predictable, and respectful.

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

* **Run as Administrator**
* Windows 11 Pro 25H2 or newer
* Restart after script completes

This script does **not modify system files**, **does not weaken security**, and **is fully reversible** via Group Policy reset.

---

## 🚀 How To Run

Right-click → Run as Administrator:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\UltimateProMode.ps1
```

---

## 🎯 Result After Running

You get a system that:

* Feels **stable like Windows 7**
* Runs **fast like Windows 10 LTSC**
* Looks **clean and minimal**
* Respects your **privacy and workflow**
* Never nags you
* Never auto-installs junk
* Never phones home for search queries

The OS becomes **your tool again**, not someone’s platform for ads + behavioral data.
This is not about *hacking* Windows.
It is about **letting Windows respect the person using it**.
